:::info Methodology

- The proposed CNN-RNN framework for multi-label image classification that learns joint image-label embedding to capture semantic label dependency and relevance.
- Long short-term memory (LSTM) neurons as recurrent neurons, which have been demonstrated to be a powerful model of long-term dependency. 
- Encoding attention models implicitly in the CNN-RNN structure, which adapts the image features based on previous prediction results.

## Data
The paper has used public benchmark datasets for multi-label image classification, including MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC. The label orders during training are determined according to their occurrence frequencies in the training data.

## Results

:::note Performance Analysis

- On the NUS-WIDE dataset, the proposed method achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.893 which is significantly higher compared to other methods.
- On MS-COCO dataset with ResNet50 as backbone network architecture in our model we achieve mAP@0.5=54% and recall@20 =70%. 
- The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving an F1-score of 90%, Hamming loss of .05 , Precision at k=.2,.5,.8 are respectively: [91%,85%,75%]

## Limitations

- The proposed CNN-RNN framework requires a large amount of training data to learn the joint image-label embedding effectively.
- The model is computationally expensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications. 
- Although the architecture achieves better performance than state-of-the-art models, it still has room for improvement in terms of accuracy on some datasets.
