:::tip Abstract in 2 Lines

This paper proposes a framework called Multi-View 3D networks (MV3D) for highly accurate 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. It takes both LIDAR point cloud and RGB images as input and predicts oriented 3D bounding boxes.

## Contributions 

- Proposing a Multi-View 3D object detection network (MV3D) that takes both LIDAR and image data as input and predicts the full 3D extent of objects in 3D space.
- Outperforming the state-of-the-art by around 25% and 30% AP on the tasks of 3D localization and 3D detection, respectively, on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Additionally, for 2D detection, the proposed approach obtains 14.9% higher AP than the state-of-the-art on the hard data among the LIDAR-based methods.

## Practical Implications

- The proposed MV3D framework can be used for highly accurate 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios, which is crucial for the safety of self-driving cars.
- The use of both LIDAR and image data as input can improve the accuracy of object detection and reduce false positives.
- The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging KITTI benchmark, which is a widely used benchmark for autonomous driving research. This indicates that the proposed approach can be used as a strong baseline for future research in this area.
