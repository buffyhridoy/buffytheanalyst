:::tip Abstract in 2 Lines

The paper compares 41 state-of-the-art models for salient object detection and segmentation over seven challenging datasets to benchmark the performance of these methods. The evaluation shows significant progress in accuracy and running time over the last few years, and the paper proposes solutions for tackling open problems in the field.

## Data

- MSRA-B: A dataset of 5,000 images with pixel-level annotations.
- MSRA-10K: A subset of MSRA-B with 10,000 images without annotations.
- HKU-IS: A dataset of 4,447 images with pixel-level annotations.
- DUT-OMRON: A dataset of 5,168 images with pixel-level annotations.
- PASCAL-S: A subset of PASCAL VOC 2010 with 850 images and pixel-level annotations.
- ECSSD: A dataset of 1,000 images with pixel-level annotations.
- SOD: A dataset of 300 images with pixel-level annotations.

## Results

:::note Performance Analysis

- The top-performing model achieves an F-measure of 0.937 on the MSRA-B dataset.
- The best model identified in the previous benchmark conducted three years ago achieved an F-measure of 0.882 on the same dataset.
- The models designed specifically for salient object detection generally work better than models in closely related areas, such as objectness and fixation prediction.
- The analysis of the influences of center bias and scene complexity in model performance shows that the models tend to have higher precision and recall for objects located near the center of the image and in simple scenes.

## Limitations

- The paper only evaluates a limited number of state-of-the-art models, and there may be other models that perform better on these datasets.
- The paper only evaluates the models on seven datasets, and there may be other datasets that are more challenging or representative of real-world scenarios.
